# Character Waypoints

A mod for Factorio.
Adds a shortcut that automatically walks the character to the current cursor position.

## issue TODOs

* there are some super small gaps where the player can walk through but not when it walks automatically

## potential TODOs

* in data.lua, what is the shortcut order?
* add a map tag for the goal? ("utility.shoot_cursor_red")
* is it interesting to save the path so that walking continues when a game is loaded?
* clean up storage: are all the variables necessary?
* if waypoint request fails, go as close as possible
